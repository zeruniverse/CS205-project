        <p>In this project we implemented a parallelized version of Deepflow algorithm. The main work that we achieved are the follows:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                        <li>We studied optical flow algorithm and analyzed a state-of-the-art implementation of optical flow algorithm 
                                to identify computational-heavy parts in this algorithm for parallelization. </li>
                        <li>On image level, we implemented Red-Black SOR method, a more accurate, efficient and parallelizable optimization method to 
                        make the original algorithm parallelizable and keep the same level of accuracy at the same time. </li>
                        <li>On video level, we implemented a robust Map-Reduce pipeline for image processing on Hadoop platform using HDFS
                                to utilize the power of clusters.</li>
                        <li>We tried other various kinds of parallelization algorithms and programming models that we studied this semester. 
                                We did comprehensive evaluation of these methods and created a high-performance hybrid model for video processing.</li>
                        <li>We built two applications, namely fake slow motion video and video stylization with our parallelized optical flow algorithm.</li>                        
                </ol>
        
        <p>Computer vision is one of the most important area where big compute and big data techniques can be heavily used. 
                This is the reason why we choose a problem in this area as the topic of our final project. 
                There are still many open problems in optical flow regarding how to improve the latency and the accuracy. 
                We hope our work can give some insights to other reasearchers to help them better incoroperate the idea of
                big compute and big data in further improvements of the design of optical flow algorithms. </p>
