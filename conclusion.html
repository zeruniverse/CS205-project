        <h2 class='entry-title'>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In this project we implemented a parallelized version of Deepflow algorithm. The main work that we achieved are the follows:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                        <li>We studied optical flow algorithm and analyzed a state-of-the-art implementation of optical flow algorithm 
                                to identify computational-heavy parts in this algorithm for parallelization. </li>
                        <li>On image level, we implemented Red-Black SOR method, a more accurate, efficient and parallelizable optimization method to 
                        make the original algorithm parallelizable and at the same time keep accuracy at the same level. </li>
                        <li>On video level, we implemented a robust Map-Reduce pipeline for image processing on Hadoop platform using HDFS
                                to utilize the power of clusters.</li>
                        <li>We tried other various kinds of parallelization algorithms and programming models that we studied this semester and 
                                did comprehensive evaluation of these methods. We learned that OpenMP and MapReduce achieve significant speedup for our task, while MPI and OpenACC might not be suitable for our case.                
                        </li>
                         <li>We created a high-performance hybrid model based on OpenMP and MapReduce for video processing.</li>
                        <li>We built two applications, namely fake slow motion video and video stylization with our parallelized optical flow algorithm.</li>                        
                </ol>
        
        <p>Insight: Computer vision is one of the most important area where big compute and big data techniques can be heavily used. 
                This is the reason why we choose a problem in this area as the topic of our final project. Our work shows that 
                OpenMP and MapReduce can make significant improvement in optical flow computation. We also learnt GPU acceleration and MPI are not always helpful. Although both of them bring in more computation power, but they might add even more overheads.</p>
                
          <p> Future work: There are still many open problems in optical flow regarding how to improve the latency and the accuracy. 
                Several further researches exist for our project, including making MPI more efficient in our use case, and applying 
                  parallelization in other state-of-the-art implementations of optical flow.
                  We also hope our work can give some insights to other reasearchers to help them better incoroperate the idea of
                big compute and big data in further improvements of the design of optical flow algorithms. </p>
