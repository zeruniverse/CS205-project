# Flow Format Converter

This tool converts `.flo` files generated by deepflow to `.sVflow` files used by [slomoVideo](https://github.com/slowmoVideo/slowmoVideo) to produce slow-motion videos.

## How to use

Simply compile by running `make` command in this folder.

The running command is:

```bash
./converter input.flo output.sVflow
```

There is a `run.sh` bash script in this folder to help convert all flow files for the entire video. You should create two empty folders `input` and `output`. Put all `.flo` files into input and run the bash file, you will have all corresponding `.sVflow` files in `output` folder.
